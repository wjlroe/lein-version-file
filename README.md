# lein-version-file

A Leiningen plugin that writes your project version to a file
(`./VERSION` in the root of your project).

## Usage

Put `[lein-version-file "0.0.1"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
project.clj. Or in the `:plugins` vector in the `:dev` profile in your project.clj.

When using as a plugin, lein-version-file will write your project's
version to a file when you run certain Leiningen tasks: `compile`,
`test`, `midje`, `check`, `repl` and `run` (possibly others, it
depends on what is run using `eval-in-project` in Leiningen).

    $ lein version-file

Manually write the version from your project.clj to a file.
